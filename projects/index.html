          <h1> Estuary</h1>
          <p>
            Estuary is a platform for collaboration and learning through live coding. It enables you to create sound, music, and visuals in a web browser. Key features include:
          </p>
          <p>Built-in tutorials and reference materials, a growing collection of different interfaces and live coding languages, support for networked ensembles (whether in the same room or distributed around the world), text localization to an expanding set of natural languages, visual customization via themes (described by CSS
          </p>
          <p>Estuary has been developed in Haskell using Reflex and Reflex DOM (compiled to JS using GHCJS).</p>

        <h1>Precipitate</h1>
        <p>Precipitate was my MA 'MRP' (major research project). I created a distributed web-based sound installation and performance system that re-sonified the sound captured by the phones of participants/audience members anywhere in the world. I framed Precipitate as a posthuman environmental art piece and was heavily influenced by <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674064225">this</a> book (The Ecological Thought - Timothy Morton).

        <h1>ABLE</h1>
        <p>Able is a wearable platform designed to encourage physical therapy and exercise. When players exercise, their movements generate pleasurable sound and visual experiences. These incentivize users to continue physical therapy on a daily basis and in pairs.
        </p>
        <p>I worked on ABLE from May to September 2018.</p>

        <h1>Inner Ear</h1>
        <p>
          Inner Ear is a platform that hosts ear training exercises for musicians and electro-acoustic students. It is used in introductory digital audio classes at McMaster University and undergraduate electro-acoustics classes at Concordia University.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inner Ear has been developed in Haskell using Reflex and Reflex DOM, and the JavaScript Web Audio API.

        <h1>CrowdPatching</h1>
        <p>CrowdPatching was the title of my undergraduate Honors BArtsSC. Thesis. I created a participatory audiovisual performance system for engaging audience members in live coding performance. Audience members connected their smartphone to a local WiFi network in the performance space. Their devices would stream accelerometer data which would influence visuals projected on a large screen and stereo audio. While performing with the system I could also play sound out through audience devices. I presented a paper on CrowdPatching at the International Conference on Live Coding 2017, in Morelia, Mexico.

        <h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>I write a fair bit of software for performing music - mostly SuperCollider extension classes which can be found <a href="https://www.github.com/JamieBeverley/SuperCollider-Extensions">here</a>.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.github.com/JamieBeverley/smartphone-soundscapes">Smartphone Soundscapes </a> is a live coding performance system that leverages the Web Audio API to perform music through audience members' phones. Audience members connect their smartphones to a locally hosted WiFi network and the performer (me) issues instructions to their phones to play back soundfiles. I've performed this twice - when enough phones are connected (and the system is working) the resultant soundscape is quite immersive.</li>
